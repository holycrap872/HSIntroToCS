In Introduction to Computer Science we have wrapped up our first unit of study
in which we explore numbering systems and how computers store various types of
information such as text, images, and emojis. We have now turned our focus to
learning how to program in Python. This will include learning the specific
syntax of Python as well as how to utilize the control structures (e.g., loops,
conditionals) that are common in many other languages. These topics can often be
difficult, so I encourage you to take advantage of the extra support available
outside of class held in C222 every Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.

XXX, you are off to a good start in this course. Your average of XXX% on the
assignments thus far in unit 1 is due to one homework not being handed in; the
other assignments all earned top marks. Careful attention to assignment due
dates will help bring the grade average up.

XXX, you've completed all of your homework assignments; however, the grade on our first quiz (XXX%) does not show that you have mastered the material as well as could be hoped. Be sure to take careful notes in class and ask questions about anything you don't understand.
