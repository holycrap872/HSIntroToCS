# High School Introduction to CS

This repository attempts to capture a full year, every other-day class that
introduces high schoolers to various facets of Computer Science. The students
within the course are in 9th grade with a range of previous exposure to
computing.

## Mission

This course provides (the majority of) students their first rigorous encounter
with topics underlying modern day computers. Students will learn why computers
must use zeros and ones, how this can be used to represent different kinds of
data, and how that data can be stored, transmitted and manipulated by
algorithms / computer code. An emphasis is placed on pair-programming, problem
solving, and differentiated difficulty.

## Navigation

To understand the course, there are three places to look:

- The [Course Syllabus](./CourseMaterials/course_documents/syllabus.md) document for 
  the general expectations of the course handed out at the beginning of the class.
- The [Course Overview](./CourseMaterials/course_documents/course_overview.md)
  document for and understanding of the units of covered in during the class.
- The [Course Documents](./CourseMaterial/) folder for the full set of lesson plans
  and activities.

## Contributions

Overall, this course is a work in progress and I am open to any/all suggestions.
