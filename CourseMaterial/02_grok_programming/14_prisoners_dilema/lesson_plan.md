## Essential Questions:

- How can we use arrays to make decisions over time
- How can computers be used to solve problems in other disciplines

## Lesson Plan

### Setup

- Sheets printed out

### Actual Lesson

- Review
    - Lists
    - Iterators
    - append()
- Who's heard of Prisoners Dilemma?
    - Lucky and Joe rob a bank and then get picked up by police
    - Draw out grid
- Give demo with two volunteers
    - Track the score on the board for five rounds
    - Come up with names for each of their strategies
    - Create function stubs (aka: `prisoner_1(other_choices):`)
- Where do we see these types of situations?
    - Abstract problem of cooperation
    - Other ideas
        - Write up on board and leave them there
- Program together
    - Use the `prisoner_1(other_choices):` as a base
    - Explain the functions
    - Jerk Bot
    - Con-man bot (array length)
- Tournament
    - Play the person to your left
    - Play the person to your right
    - Two students with highest two point totals play in front of everyone
    - Have winner explain their strategy
- Start worksheet
    - Explain that it is an encoding of this game
    - Slowly work up to building your own bot in python
    - Will play all the big bots against eachother in an "arena"
- Go!
