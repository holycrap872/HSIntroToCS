## Essential Questions

- How can we use loops to efficiently process data?

## Lesson Plan

### Setup

`EmojiPics Worksheet` in a GoogleDoc posted to Schoology

### Actual Lesson

- Quiz on Grok lessons up to 5.2
- Start groking after this
    - Should be starting lesson 5.3 (accumulators)
    - Let Grok for 15 - 20m
- Review quiz
    - Field any questions
- Break
- Classwork prep
    - Today going to do first real, interesting program
        - Going to give you the code b/c reading/understanding code most important skill
    - What are accumulators
    - Run through initial program in emoji pics
        - What is it doing?
        - Why `row = ""`
        - What happens if we replace it with emojis?
            - Called "mapping"
            - Replacing one type of thing with another
                - {"1": white, "0": black}
            - For those at dictionaries, here's an example
- Classwork
    - Have them read over worksheet
    - Walk through code and show the variables they will be "using"
    - Go!
- About half way through pull them back for a quick refresher on grayscale and RGB
- Go again!
- Cool final trick
    - Copy B/W data into a text file
    - Shrink so that 2's are all lined up on right edge: Can see figure
    - If then Make it so every other 2 is lined up on edge: Can see figure twice!
