## Essential Questions

- How should we visualize if/elif/else and loops?
- How do we use loops to model repeating patterns?

## Lesson Plan

### Setup

The goal of this lesson is to prepare the slower students for loops. This is
because the loop lesson is the largest jump in terms of complexity. Therefore,
we'll do a bunch or prep and classwork to prepare students for it so that they
don't become too frustrated.

### Actual Lesson

- Review
    - String functions
    - if/elif/else
- How do we think of if/elif/else in real life
    - Various analogies (hiking trail)
    - Some example "real life" programs
- How do we think about loops
    - Iterating through a list of things
    - Bunch of sample programs
    - Loop as a hiking trail
    - Loop as a series of patterns
- Start Grok

- Finish Grok Lesson 4
