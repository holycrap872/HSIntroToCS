## Essential Questions

- How can we use the past to predict the future?

## Lesson Plan

This game is mostly a time-killer with a slight academic twist. By asking
students to record the game as they go, they get an idea of who they can have
the most (probability) of trusting.

The explanation/game takes up ~45m before students start to get bored.

### Setup

Enough versions of Skull to cover class (6 people per game)

### Actual Lesson

- Bayesian Learning
    - Using data about the past to make decisions about the future
- Show two examples
    - 3 rows of data where have to make a decision
    - 10 rows of data where have to make a decision
- Explain skull
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma1y8Lsv5tY
    - Rule changes
        - Ignore the "defer" where the lead can put down and extra card
        - Make everyone turn over their cards at the end (for data purposes)
    - Do sample round
- Explain sheet
- Do sample round
    - Fill in sheet
    - Have _one person per group_ be recorder
- Go!
- Bayesian debrief
    - How did this sheet prove useful?
    - Why is filling in the sheet an example of Bayesian learning?
