# Shell Lesson

Shell is a fundamental tool in a programmer's tool belt. It allows users to
access more advanced commands that are hidden from the GUI. In addition, it
allows users to easily chain together commands so that an initial input is
incrementally modified on its way to becoming a useful output.

This lesson involves three parts: research, reflection, and application.

## Research

Take the udacity "intro to shell" course. The course is available at
https://www.udacity.com/course/shell-workshop--ud206 . The course has a _lot_ of
good information information about things such as alias's, pipes, and
environment variables. I'd strongly suggest watching the videos fully even if
you think you know all the information.

## Reflection:

1. What is the GUI equivalant of `cd`?
   ```


   ```
2. Why do you need to be careful with the `rm` command?
   ```


   ```
3. In 2-3 sentences, explain why the concept of "piping" is so powerful?
   ```



   ```
4. What is the difference between and absolute path and a relative path?
   ```



   ```
5. What does the environment variable PYTHONPATH do? How could you use it in the future?
   ```
   
   

   ```

## Application:

See how far you can get in https://overthewire.org/wargames . To get started,
you will need to "ssh" into a demonstration computer using the following
command:

```
ssh -p 2220 bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org
```

Keep a list of the passwords you discover as you go through the levels. If you
get up to level nine, consider yourself "up to speed" on shell, but feel free
to see how far you can get.

> Make sure to read the directions carefully for each "challenge". There are
  some very helpful hints.

> This is a _difficult_ demo and requires careful reading, but you will learn
  A LOT

#### Passwords

Write the **first three characters** of each password in the space below. In
addition, I would suggest keeping a local copy of a complete list of all the
passwords on your computer just in case.

1. bandit1@bandit password:
2. bandit2@bandit password:
3. bandit3@bandit password:
4. bandit4@bandit password:
5. bandit5@bandit password:
6. bandit6@bandit password:
7. bandit7@bandit password:
8. bandit9@bandit password:
9. bandit0@bandit password:
10. bandit10@bandit password:
