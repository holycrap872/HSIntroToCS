## Advanced Progression

The advanced (extension) content is available at
https://gitlab.ucls.uchicago.edu/erizzi/intro-cs-extension . I put this content
in it's own place for two reasons:

1. It's kind of its own course
2. To allow advanced students to fix bugs/add questions to the worksheets (collaborate)
